Automatic, silent consent layer for the official Microsoft Clarity plugin - grants consent automatically for internal websites.

== Description ==
Silent Consent for Microsoft Clarity is a lightweight consent layer that works on top of the official Microsoft Clarity plugin. It automatically applies consent settings to Microsoft Clarity without interfering with the original plugin configuration.
The plugin is designed and developed only and exclusively for protected, corporate websites, cases where acceptance of cookies is not strictly necessary and against European regulation. The responsibility in case of misuse with respect to the European regulation, lies with the end administrator (who chooses to install and use this plugin).

**Key Features:**
* Automatic consent management for Microsoft Clarity
* Works as a layer on top of the official Microsoft Clarity plugin
* Configurable Ad Storage and Analytics Storage consent settings
* Automatic Project ID detection from existing Clarity installations
* Multi-language support (English and Italian included)
* Zero interference with Microsoft Clarity plugin functionality
* Safe mode operation - read-only detection of existing configurations

**Perfect for:**
* Internal company websites where consent is always granted
* Development and testing environments
* Websites where manual consent management is not required
* GDPR-compliant setups with pre-approved consent policies

**How it works:**
1. Install and activate the official Microsoft Clarity plugin
2. Configure Microsoft Clarity with your Project ID
3. Install Silent Consent for Microsoft Clarity
4. Configure your consent preferences (Grant/Deny for Ad Storage and Analytics Storage)
5. The plugin automatically applies consent to Clarity on page load

**Important:** This plugin requires the official Microsoft Clarity plugin to be installed and active. It acts as a consent layer and does not replace the Microsoft Clarity functionality. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Microsoft.

2. Configure Microsoft Clarity with your Project ID
3. Download and install **Silent Consent for Microsoft Clarity**
4. Activate the plugin
5. Go to Settings > Clarity Consent to configure your consent preferences
6. The consent will be automatically applied to all Clarity tracking

**Manual Installation:**

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin replace Microsoft Clarity? =
No. This plugin works as a consent layer on top of the official Microsoft Clarity plugin. You need both plugins installed and active.

= Will this interfere with my existing Clarity configuration? =
No. The plugin operates in read-only mode and never modifies your Microsoft Clarity settings. It only adds consent information.

= What happens if I change my Project ID in Microsoft Clarity? =
The plugin automatically detects Project ID changes and adapts accordingly. No manual configuration needed.

= Can I use this on production websites? =
Yes, but ensure you comply with your local privacy laws. This plugin is designed for scenarios where consent is pre-approved or not required.

= Is it GDPR compliant? =
The plugin provides technical consent management, but GDPR compliance depends on your specific use case and legal requirements. Consult with legal experts for your specific situation.

= Which languages are supported? =
Currently English and Italian are included. The plugin uses WordPress translation system, so additional languages can be easily added.

= Is this plugin affiliated with Microsoft? =
No. "Microsoft Clarity" is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation. This plugin is an independent, unaffiliated add-on that only reads the configuration of the official Microsoft Clarity plugin.
